<h2>Why this exists?</h2>

This is where you can get my version of Modified Dark Neon theme, original version made by [@B4T3S](https://github.com/B4T3S).<br>
All modifications I've made are mainly focusing on two subjects, **unstyled elements** and **add borders to element**<br>
Borders can be customized, so if you don't like any of them, just disable it and download your version.

<h2>How to download this?</h2>

The answer is simple except if you need further customization. 
1. Head over to the [website](). (tutorial is given there too)
2. Choose `Customize`
3. Select `Default` at preset section
4. Click `Download` for the default version
5. Import it into your discord, it should be replacing Bates's version
